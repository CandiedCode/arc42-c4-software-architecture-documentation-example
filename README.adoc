= Software Architecture Documentation Example with arc42 and C4 Model

This example shows how to use arc42 in combination with the C4 model with the Documentation as Code technique.

Technologies involved:

* https://arc42.org/[arc42] to get the structure for the software architecture documentation
* https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] an "abstraction-first" approach to diagramming software architecture, based upon abstractions that reflect how software architects and developers think about and build software.
* https://structurizr.com/dsl[Structurizr DSL] to describe the https://c4model.com/[C4 Model] of the software system
* https://github.com/structurizr/cli[Structurizr CLI] a command line utility for Structurizr to export the https://plantuml.com/[PlantUML] diagrams from the C4 Model described in the Structurizr DSL
* https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] as format to write the software architecture documentation
* https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor] to generate the representations of the software architecture documentation written in asciidoc

== Prerequisites

* Install https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor[Asciidoctor], https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/[Asciidoctor Diagrams] and https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/[Asciidoctor PDF]
** https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/[Asciidoctor]
** https://docs.asciidoctor.org/diagram-extension/latest/[Asciidoctor-Diagrams]
** https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/install/[Asciidoctor-PDF]
* Download the https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip[structurizr-cli], unzip and move it into `./bin/structurizr-cli`
[source, bash]
----
curl --show-error --location https://static.structurizr.com/download/structurizr-cli.zip  -o tmp.zip && unzip -d bin/structurizr-cli/. tmp.zip && rm tmp.zip
----
* Generate the diagrams from the structurizr workspace model
[source, bash]
----
./bin/structurizr-cli/structurizr.sh export -w bank.dsl -format plantuml/structurizr -output diagrams
----

== Generate the software architecture documentation representations

*Generate the documentation as HTML representation*

[source, bash]
----
asciidoctor -b html5 -r asciidoctor-diagram internet-banking-system.adoc
----

*Generate the documentation as PDF representation*

[source, bash]
----
asciidoctor -b pdf -r asciidoctor-diagram -r asciidoctor-pdf  internet-banking-system.adoc
----
